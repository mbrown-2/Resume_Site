                <p>
                    My interest in this language began recently in May 2022. After collaborating with other students 
                    who were well-versed with Swift, I decided it would be a fun personal-goal to see how much I could 
                    learn about this language throughout the summer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To do so, I began the <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui?gclid=CjwKCAjwt7SWBhAnEiwAx8ZLautC-jOp5rtdbWq7impbzPUYj0guRWW6alijFtn3Sd5WJZDcQhUyHBoCb00QAvD_BwE">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>
                    challenge which combines the language with an emphasis on <em>app development</em> (a topic that I find great interest in). Hence,
                    the following section is dedicated to hosting a portfolio of my advancements with SwiftUI. They might seem like small and simple programs, but each accomplishment is another step closer towards mastery.

                <table>
                    <caption>Functionality with Swift</caption>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Column 1</th>

                                <p>Captured from an early test model for the PlantPal application. Features a simple implementation of a list of links to seperate views.</p>

                                    Also captured from PlantPal. Showcases a simple ZStack with two views: an image and a pre-programmed radial bar.
                                    The result is the illusion that the health-bar wraps around the image.

                            </details>

                <p>
                    SwiftUI won't be my only endeavor. Throughout the future, I have plans to explore other languages that I've once 
                    never had the time to do so. Some of the langauges are titled above, which I soon hope to showcase on this page 
                    throughout the future. Stay tuned!
