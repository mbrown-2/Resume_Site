                    In this case, I decided to jump in head-first, assuming that building a simple website 
                    would be easy as pie. But to tell you the truth, the results speak louder than words. 
                    Still don't believe me? <a href="https://dapper-mousse-4648f1.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">take a look 
                    here for yourself</a>.
                    <br /><br />
                    The following website was built to document a 10-week project that involved myself and a team of 
                    student engineers to develop an original IoT (Internet of Things) product. This project not only included 
                    programming and hardware architecture, but so too did it challenge us to work with real-life constraints
                    (such as resource management, customer sustainability, product marketing, and user accessibility). The 
                    result was a product known as PlantPal whose final video pitch can be seen under my 
                    <a href="videos.html">Videos tab</a>.
                    <br /><br />
                    I recognize this project as one worth mentioning because of the unfamiliar territory I pushed myself to evolve in.
                    I worked with wonderful students I had never met before, combined my programming abilities with a team of mixed 
                    skillsets and backgrounds, and took part in crafting a unique idea with real-world parameters.
