                You could think of this page as a means of expressing my inner self rather than my programming prowess
                (well... unless you want to consider amateur video directing and editing as considerable strengths too).
                Nevertheless, the videos below showcase some notable projects I was lucky enough to take part of and promote
                throughout my time at UCSD. Hope you enjoy!
            </p>

                    <h3>PlantPal Final Product Pitch</h3>
                    <h4>The culmination of a 10-week project in a team of 4 students to build a believable IoT product from the ground-up.</h4>

                        <p>
                            The PlantPal project was a major step beyond my comfort zone. Before any of this, my skillsets pertained mostly to software and programming. 
                            This project, howevever, felt more like a real-world introduction to actual product development. Throughout the 10 weeks, I was able to collaborate with 
                            other students whose backgrounds were in electrical engineering. Through them, I was able to learn more about hardware design and experience first-hand how 
                            hardware and software design interlink.

                            But in the end, technical achievement plays one role out of many when it comes to the practical management of an actual product. In other words, 
                            this project challenged my team and I to consider real-world ethics and limitations such as conducting surveys with real people to identify 
                            user niches and accessibility preferences as well as mapping out resource restrictions and product pricing for maintaining a sustainable income.

                <h2>My First "Bullseye" Attempt at Web-Development</h2>
                <p>
                    One might be aware of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but does that make them well-versed? To establish context, 
                    I decided to jump head-first into web development for a class assignment that didn't demand such effort. The goal of this site was to 
                    support a week-to-week documentation of sprint updates and reflections in association with a group project ("PlantPal", as mentioned 
                    in other sections of this website). Although every student was provided a skeleton of markup to easily attach code to, I was 
                    confident that I could build my own site from scratch. Hence, I believed this endeavor would be easy as pie. But to tell you the truth, 
                    the results speak louder than words. 
                    Don't believe me? <a href="https://dapper-mousse-4648f1.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can check out the site

                    The following website was built to document a 10-week project that involved myself and a team of 
                    student engineers to develop an original IoT (Internet of Things) product. This project not only included 
                    programming and hardware architecture, but so too did it challenge us to work with real-life constraints
                    (such as resource management, customer sustainability, product marketing, and user accessibility). The 
                    result was a product known as PlantPal whose final video pitch can be seen under my 
                    <a href="videos.html">Videos tab</a>.
