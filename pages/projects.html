                <h2>My First "Bullseye" Attempt at Web-Development</h2>
                <p>
                    One might be aware of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but does that make them well-versed? To establish context, 
                    I decided to jump head-first into web development for a class assignment that didn't demand such effort. The goal of this site was to 
                    support a week-to-week documentation of sprint updates and reflections in association with a group project ("PlantPal", as mentioned 
                    in other sections of this website). Although every student was provided a skeleton of markup to easily attach code to, I was 
                    confident that I could build my own site from scratch. Hence, I believed this endeavor would be easy as pie. But to tell you the truth, 
                    the results speak louder than words. 
                    Don't believe me? <a href="https://dapper-mousse-4648f1.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can check out the site 
                    by clicking here</a>.

                    The following website was built to document a 10-week project that involved myself and a team of 
                    student engineers to develop an original IoT (Internet of Things) product. This project not only included 
                    programming and hardware architecture, but so too did it challenge us to work with real-life constraints
                    (such as resource management, customer sustainability, product marketing, and user accessibility). The 
                    result was a product known as PlantPal whose final video pitch can be seen under my 
                    <a href="videos.html">Videos tab</a>.
