                You could think of this page as a means of expressing my inner self rather than my programming prowess
                (well... unless you want to consider amateur video directing and editing as considerable strengths too).
                Nevertheless, the videos below showcase some notable projects I was lucky enough to take part of and promote
                throughout my time at UCSD. Hope you enjoy!
            </p>

                    <h3>PlantPal Final Product Pitch</h3>
                    <h4>The culmination of a 10-week project in a team of 4 students to build a believable IoT product from the ground-up.</h4>

                            The PlantPal project was a major step beyond my comfort zone. Before any of this, my skillsets pertained mostly to software and programming. 
                            This project, howevever, felt more like a real-world introduction to actual product development. Throughout the 10 weeks, I was able to collaborate with 
                            other students whose backgrounds were in electrical engineering. Through them, I was able to learn more about hardware design and experience first-hand how 
                            hardware and software design interlink.

                            But in the end, technical achievement plays one role out of many when it comes to the practical management of an actual product. In other words, 
                            this project challenged my team and I to consider real-world ethics and limitations such as conducting surveys with real people to identify 
                            user niches and accessibility preferences as well as mapping out resource restrictions and product pricing for maintaining a sustainable income.
